## [2026-02-08] Alertness Signal Path Implementation (KR4)

### Bug
- **Version sync issue**: CI failed initially because brain version (1.14.0) wasn't updated in DEFINITION.md and .brain-versions file. The facts-check.mjs script enforces consistency across all version references.
- **Merge conflicts**: Multiple merge conflicts occurred with develop branch, particularly in PRD/DOD files and version numbers. Need to fetch and merge develop earlier in the process.

### Optimization Points  
- **Version management**: Consider automating version bumps across all files (package.json, package-lock.json, DEFINITION.md, .brain-versions) to prevent sync issues.
- **Workflow improvement**: The /dev workflow could benefit from automatic develop branch merge before creating PR to reduce conflicts.

### Technical Achievements
- **Modular architecture**: Successfully implemented a fully modular alertness system with clean separation of concerns.
- **Seamless integration**: Integrated with existing tick loop without breaking functionality.
- **Comprehensive testing**: Created 5 test suites with good coverage.

### Impact Level: Medium
Successfully adds self-diagnosis capability to Cecelia Brain, critical for system reliability.
