# PRD: Fix Alertness Level Mismatch

## 功能描述

tick.js imports `ALERTNESS_LEVELS` from old `alertness.js` (COMA=3) but calls `evaluateAlertnessEnhanced()` from enhanced `alertness/index.js` (ALERT=3). When enhanced returns ALERT(3), tick thinks it's COMA and skips everything. This blocks all task dispatch.

Fix: Use enhanced system's constants in tick.js, add manual override to enhanced alertness.

## 成功标准

- [ ] tick.js uses enhanced ALERTNESS_LEVELS (PANIC=4 for skip-all)
- [ ] Enhanced alertness has manual override with expiration
- [ ] Override API works with enhanced system
- [ ] All tests pass
