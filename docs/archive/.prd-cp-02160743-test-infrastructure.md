# PRD: Set up test infrastructure and coverage reporting

## Background
To achieve 95% test coverage for the Thalamus decision engine (thalamus.js and cortex.js), we first need to establish proper test infrastructure and baseline metrics.

## Objectives
1. Configure Jest for comprehensive test coverage reporting
2. Establish baseline coverage metrics for thalamus.js and cortex.js
3. Set up CI integration for coverage reporting
4. Create coverage badge and reporting dashboard

## Functional Requirements
1. **Coverage Configuration**
   - Configure Jest to track coverage for thalamus.js and cortex.js
   - Set up coverage thresholds (target: 95%)
   - Configure coverage reporters (text, lcov, html)

2. **Baseline Metrics**
   - Run coverage report to establish current baseline
   - Document current coverage percentages
   - Identify uncovered code paths

3. **CI Integration**
   - Add coverage checks to GitHub Actions
   - Fail CI if coverage drops below threshold
   - Upload coverage reports to tracking service

4. **Reporting**
   - Generate coverage badge for README
   - Create HTML coverage reports
   - Set up trend tracking

## Technical Requirements
- Jest configuration in package.json or jest.config.js
- Coverage threshold configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow updates
- Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Jest configured with coverage tracking for thalamus.js and cortex.js
2. ✅ Coverage thresholds set to 95% for statements, branches, functions, and lines
3. ✅ CI pipeline runs coverage checks on every PR
4. ✅ Coverage reports generated and accessible
5. ✅ Baseline metrics documented
6. ✅ Coverage badge added to README
