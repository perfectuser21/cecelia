开发过程中的经验总结和最佳实践。

### [2026-02-14] Skip Local Tests During Brain Deployment

- **Bug**: Brain deployment script runs local tests that conflict with running Brain service on port 5221
  - When Brain is running: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5221`
  - When Brain is stopped: Tests fail with connection errors
  - Solution: Skip local test execution during deployment since CI already validates all tests

- **优化点**: Deployment scripts should avoid duplicating CI checks
  - CI is the source of truth for test results
  - Local deployment should focus on: build → migrate → selfcheck → deploy → health check
  - Tests belong in CI, not in deployment scripts

- **影响程度**: Medium
  - Blocked deployment until fixed
  - Simple solution (skip test step)
  - No actual code quality impact (CI still validates)

### [2026-02-14] Schema Version Update Requires Version Sync

- **Bug**: .brain-versions format issue - file had two lines instead of one
  - CI script uses `tr -d '\n'` which concatenates all lines
  - Writing "1.38.0\n1.38.0\n" resulted in "1.38.01.38.0"
  - Solution: Use `jq -r .version brain/package.json > .brain-versions` (single line)
  - Root cause: Manual file writing didn't match expected format

- **优化点**: Schema version updates require multi-file sync
  - `brain/src/selfcheck.js`: EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION constant
  - `brain/src/__tests__/selfcheck.test.js`: Test expectation
  - `brain/package.json`: Version bump (feat: → minor, fix: → patch)
  - `brain/package-lock.json`: Auto-synced via `npm version`
  - `.brain-versions`: Single line version via jq
  - `DEFINITION.md`: Brain 版本 and Schema 版本 fields
  - `VERSION`: Project-level version file
  - Missing any of these will fail CI (Version Check or Facts Consistency)

- **影响程度**: Low
  - Simple task (1 line code change) required 3 CI retry cycles
  - All issues caught by CI before merge
  - Clear error messages guided fixes
  - Workflow validated - /dev handled iterative CI fixes correctly
