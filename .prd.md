# PRD: Fix Alertness Level Mismatch

## Problem

tick.js imports `ALERTNESS_LEVELS` from old `alertness.js` (COMA=3) but calls `evaluateAlertnessEnhanced()` from enhanced `alertness/index.js` (ALERT=3). When enhanced returns ALERT(3), tick thinks it's COMA and skips everything.

## Solution

1. tick.js: Use enhanced system's level constants
2. alertness/index.js: Add manual override support
3. routes.js: Update override endpoint for enhanced system
