# PRD: Add tests for gradual ramp-up dispatch

## 功能描述
PR #302 implemented getRampedDispatchMax() but without unit tests. Add comprehensive tests to verify the gradual ramp-up logic: cold start, incremental increase, ceiling clamping, pressure/alertness-based reduction, and recovery.

## 成功标准
- All ramp-up scenarios covered by tests
- Export getRampedDispatchMax for test access
- CI passes
